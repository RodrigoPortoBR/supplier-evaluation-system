1. ROBUSTNESS, SCALE, AND RELIABILITY
 
Scalability track record
 
Highest concurrent peak supported
We have supported multiple campaigns with cumulative audiences in the millions of participants across the full campaign lifecycle. For instance, one one our main clients is Real Madrid, so everytime they launch an interactive campaign they target their 170M followers across all their channels.
 
Type of events
These peaks typically occur in:
Large sports-related prediction games
TV and live broadcast activations
Short time-window promotional mechanics (draws, instant wins, voting)
Peaks usually concentrate in very short time frames (minutes) around live moments.
 
Case studies above 1M / 5M / 10M users
We have documented projects above 1M total users. For instance Real Madrid or retail campaigns for beer companies.
For volumes beyond that (5M–10M+), we typically operate under custom enterprise setups, where:
Infrastructure is specifically sized
Traffic patterns are clearly defined
Load testing and contingency plans are agreed in advance

 

10M users submitting predictions 5 minutes before a match
In that scenario, we would not rely on a standard shared environment.
Our approach would be:
Dedicated infrastructure
Predefined rate-limiting and queueing strategies
Pre-match submission windows

 

 
Technical architecture
Infrastructure
Easypromos runs on Google Cloud Platform. 
Please have a look to our Security Work Paper where we explain in detail our technical platform.
(See attached doc: Easypromos Security Work Paper.pdf)
 
Dedicated environment
No, it's not possible. Easypromos is a SAAS Platform, we do not create dedicated environments because we manage the platform as a whole.
 
Layer separation
Yes, we're based on an MVC architecture. There is a clear separation between:
Product / business logic layer
Data layer
Front-end layer
This allows us to scale, secure, and customize each layer independently.
Platform availability
Web (desktop & mobile):  YES
Native iOS / Android apps: No, we can integrate in any mobile app via webview.
 
Performance and testing
Stress testing
Yes, we perform stress and load testing regularly.
 
Dedicated load tests
For large events, we can run custom load tests, including:
Concentrated pre-match spikes
Millions of actions in short windows
These tests are typically aligned with the agreed traffic model for the event.
 
SLA and operations
Support model
Business-hours support is standard
24/7 support and on-call coverage can be provided for live events as part of an enterprise agreement

 

Brazil support
Support is centralized, but we are experienced working with Brazilian clients and LGPD requirements
Time-zone–aligned on-call coverage can be arranged
 
Dedicated SRE during events
Yes, for large live events we provide dedicated technical monitoring and escalation protocols
 
2. SECURITY, LGPD, AND DATA GOVERNANCE
The platform is LGPD-compliant
User consent is handled explicitly through configurable opt-ins
Data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure.

 

Roles
Data controller: typically the client
Data processor: Easypromos

 

Data capabilities
Full data export: Yes. You will be able to export all user data via CSV, direct integrations with common CRMs or via API/Webhook.
Require anonymization / pseudonymization?: it's something we could do as part of a custom request.
 
 
3. CORE PLATFORM FEATURES (PRODUCT)
 
Types of predictions
Match result --> Yes
Exact score --> Yes
Special predictions (first goal, winner, qualifiers, etc.) --> Yes
Live predictions: No, we do support live predictions.

 

Rankings
Global rankings --> Yes
Public leagues --> No.
Private leagues --> No.
Period-based rankings (daily, matchday, tournament) --> Yes.

 

Private leagues
We do not support priavte leagues but it could be discussed if this is a request from your client.

 

Scoring system
Fully configurable --> Yes
Multiple scoring rules can coexist in the same competition --> Yes

 

Gamification
Missions / challenges
Badges / achievements
 
Regarding gamification, the platform currently includes a virtual currency–based system that allows us to effectively simulate and manage missions, challenges, badges, and achievements in a flexible and scalable way.
 
In parallel, we are actively developing a next-generation challenge system that will significantly expand these capabilities. While this new system is not yet ready to be presented or documented, it is already part of our internal roadmap, and we would be happy to discuss its vision, principles, and potential use cases during our meeting.
 
Prizes
Ranking-based prizes
Draws / raffles
Tiered prizes (daily / weekly / overall)
 
Regarding prizes, this is actually one of the strongest and most mature areas of our platform.
Prize assignment rules are fully configurable and can be combined. To give you a more concrete and detailed view, I’m sharing a couple of links below:
Tutorial: Managing Prizes and Winners
Prize Management Systems: How to distribute prizes on online promotions
 
 
Content & narrative APIs
Please have a look to our API and Webhooks:

4. CUSTOMIZATION, UX, AND FRONT-END
 
Branding & white-label
Fully white-label front-end aligned with client brand guidelines

Please have a look to:

Easypromos design guide

Designing Interactive Promotions with Easypromos

 
Front-end delivery
We have multiple real-world delivered front-end projects
See :
Easypromos Success Cases
All the examples
Easypromos catalog: every product has full operational demos and examples
 
UX/UI & front-end services
Easypromos is not a development or design agency. We do not offer custom development because our development team is focused on building a robust, fully self-service platform.
That said, for large clients we can consider tailor-made projects built on top of the standard product to adapt to specific functionality they may need.
However, we do not undertake fully custom projects from scratch.
 
5. ROADMAP AND EVOLUTION CAPACITY
In line with the previous point, the message is the same. We do not offer custom development. However, if based on the standard product shown to the client there are certain functionalities they would like to have that are not currently available, we can review this together.
We can agree on a list of required features and assess which ones could potentially be incorporated into the product. We can discuss this during the video call and see how close our current product is to what the client is actually looking for.
 
 
6. PARTNER INTEGRATION AND ECOSYSTEM
 
APIs & integrations
SSO / external login: supported
Partner integrations: supported via APIs
We can integrate:
Partner benefits
Subscription or entitlement status
External reward systems

 

Multi-player ecosystem
Yes, we have operated projects involving:
Sponsors
Media
Strategic partners simultaneously
Supported features include:
Co-branding
Exclusive areas or mechanics per partner

7. WHATSAPP AND NOTIFICATIONS
We don't have a native Whatsapp integration. 
 
8. SOCIAL SHARING & VIRALITY
Easypromos provides a virality system that is 100% configurable, enabling you to display different messages depending on the promotion type. See more info: Tutorial: promotion virality system.
