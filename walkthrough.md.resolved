# Supplier Evaluation System - Walkthrough

This document demonstrates how to use the newly created Supplier Evaluation System.

## System Components

1.  **[Evaluation Template (Markdown)](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/supplier_evaluation_template.md)**: The "Form" for structuring data.
2.  **[Rules & Output Logic](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/system_rules_and_outputs.md)**: The "Brain" for analyzing risks.

## Workflow: Unstructured Ingestion (Agent-Led)

If you have raw notes, transcripts, or emails:

1.  **Send Content**: Paste the text (or attach transcript files) into this chat.
    *   *Note: For audio files, please provide the transcript.*
2.  **Instruction**: Tell me "Use this to evaluate [Supplier Name]".
3.  **Process**: I will analyze the text, extract evidence, and generate a filled **[Supplier Evaluation Template](supplier_evaluation_template.md)** for you.
4.  **Review**: You simply verify the filled markdown file I generate.

## Conclusion

The system successfully:
1.  Captures structured data ensuring no blocks were missed.
2.  Identifies specific fatal flaws (Scale) matching the Rules.
3.  Generates a clear, defensible "Status" based on the evidence provided.

## Workflow B: Unstructured Ingestion (Agent-Led)

If you have raw notes, transcripts, or emails:

1.  **Send Content**: Paste the text (or attach transcript files) into this chat.
    *   *Note: For audio files, please provide the transcript.*
2.  **Instruction**: Tell me "Use this to evaluate [Supplier Name]".
3.  **Process**: I will analyze the text, extract evidence, and generate a filled **[Supplier Evaluation Template](supplier_evaluation_template.md)** for you.
4.  **Review**: You simply verify the filled markdown file I generate.

## Conclusion

The system successfully:
1.  Captured structured data ensuring no blocks were missed.
2.  Identified specific fatal flaws (Scale) that might be hidden in sales pitches.
3.  Generated a clear, defensible "DISCARD" recommendation based on objective rules.
