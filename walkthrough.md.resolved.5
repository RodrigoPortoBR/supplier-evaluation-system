# Supplier Evaluation System - Walkthrough

This document demonstrates how to use the newly created Supplier Evaluation System.

## Agent Workflow

This system is designed for **Zero-Config Interaction**.

### 1. You Provide
*   **Supplier Name**
*   **Raw Context** (Paste notes, attach transcripts)

### 2. I Provide (Antigravity)
*   I automatically load [supplier_evaluation_template.md](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/supplier_evaluation_template.md).
*   I map your raw text to the rigorous checklist.
*   I verify [system_rules_and_outputs.md](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/system_rules_and_outputs.md) to flag risks.
*   I generate the final report in `evaluations/[name].md`.

### 3. Result
A standardized folder of apples-to-apples comparisons for your final decision.

## Conclusion

The system successfully:
1.  Captured structured data ensuring no blocks were missed.
2.  Identified specific fatal flaws (Scale) that might be hidden in sales pitches.
3.  Generated a clear, defensible "DISCARD" recommendation based on objective rules.
