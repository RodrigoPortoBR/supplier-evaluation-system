# Supplier Evaluation System (World Cup Scale)

A standardized, high-stakes supplier evaluation framework designed for massive-scale projects (e.g., World Cup prediction games with 10M+ users).

**This project is designed to be used with an AI Agent.** You provide the context (transcripts, docs), and the Agent structures the evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **[Evaluation Template](supplier_evaluation_template.md)**: The core artifact. The AI Agent uses this structure to organize unstructured data.
- **[System Rules](system_rules_and_outputs.md)**: The logic provided to the Agent to detect critical risks (e.g., Lack of Auto-scaling, Missing Compliance).
- **[Examples](evaluation_gpt.md)**: A real-world example of an evaluation generated by the Agent.

## 🚀 How to Use (Agent-Led Workflow)

1.  **Open an AI Chat** (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) or use this Agent.
2.  **Provide context**: Paste meeting notes, technical proposals, or transcripts.
3.  **Give the Command**:
    > "Act as a Senior Technical PMO. Use the [supplier_evaluation_template.md](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/supplier_evaluation_template.md) structure to evaluate this supplier based on the text provided. references the [system_rules_and_outputs.md](file:///C:/Users/rodri/.gemini/antigravity/brain/c02acd62-85f8-4299-96d2-99cdc92c6808/system_rules_and_outputs.md) for risk classification."
4.  **Receive Output**: The Agent will generate a filled Markdown file with specific tags for **Evidence**, **Promises**, and **Risks**.

## ⚠️ Critical Risk Detection
The system rules force the Agent to flag:
- 🔴 **Scale Risk**: Proven peaks < 10% of target.
- 🔴 **Infrastructure**: Lack of Auto-scaling or SLA < 99.9%.
- 🟠 **Security**: Missing PenTest or LGPD compliance.
- 🟠 **Roadmap**: High risk of conflict with other clients.
